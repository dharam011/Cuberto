Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m excited to share this web project Iâ€™ve been working on. Itâ€™s a blend of modern design and cool animations, created to showcase whatâ€™s possible with some of todayâ€™s web technologies.

Whatâ€™s Inside:
Responsive Design: Whether youâ€™re on a phone or a big screen, this site adjusts beautifully, giving you a smooth experience no matter what.

Interactive Animations: Iâ€™ve used JavaScript (Shery.js) to add some fun animations that make the site feel more dynamic and engaging. Hover over elements to see them come to life!

Clean and Modern Look: The layout is straightforward but visually appealing, with Remix Icons adding a nice touch to the overall design.

Tech Stuff:
HTML5 & CSS3: The backbone of the structure and styling.
JavaScript (Shery.js): For those smooth, responsive animations.
Remix Icons: To give the UI a modern, polished look.
Resources I Used:
Remix Icons: A set of sleek icons to complement the design.
Shery.js: My go-to for adding cool animations and effects.
